      My name is Jeannie Kin M. Constantino. I was born on November 14, 2006, and I live in Babag 2, Lapu-Lapu City. I am currently studying at Lapu-Lapu City College and taking up the course Bachelor of Industrial Technology. I chose this course because I want to learn more about computers and technology. I enjoy learning new things, especially those that can help me in the future.

      I am the middle child among four siblings. Being a middle child taught me how to be understanding and responsible. My family is very important to me, and they always support me in everything I do. During my free time, I love playing sports like volleyball and badminton. These sports help me stay active, meet new friends, and enjoy my time outside school.
    </p>

    <p>
      My dream is to finish my studies and have a good job in the future. I want to help my family and become successful in the field I chose. I believe that with hard work, dedication, and faith, I can reach my goals in life. I may still be learning, but I know that every step I take brings me closer to who I want to be.
    </p>
